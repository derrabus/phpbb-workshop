1.0 Introduction

Thank you for choosing phpBB as your forum software. 
We have spent many months on this product and hope that 
you find it useful.

2.0 Installation

If you are upgrading from version 1.0.0 of phpBB please skip down to section
3.0 Upgrading. Thank you.

2.0.1 Requirements

phpBB requires very little to run, and most well configured web servers 
should be able to run phpBB. You need at least the following:

1 Web server w/PHP 3.0.15 or greater  (Apache is know to work very well with phpBB)
1 MySQL server (phpBB has been tested on 3.22 and 3.23)
1 Admin crazy enough to run a forum (That would be you :) )

2.0.2 Pre-Installation Setup

Before beginning the install you should do 3 things:

1. Make sure PHP is installed and configured on your server, you can do
this by creating a file called phpinfo.php (or .php3) on your web server.
This file should contain the following code:

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

This should, if PHP is installed correctly, produce a nicely formatted
diagnostic page that gives you ALOT of information about the current status
of PHP on your system. Make sure this page contains a section entitled
'MySQL', if it does, you're ready to continue. If this section does not
exist then you will have to contact your system administrator and have
him/her reconfigure PHP with MySQL support. If you are the system
administrator and don't know how to do this please see the PHP manual
section on installation:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/installation.php

2. You must edit the file config.php. In this file you will have to set
the path to phpBB, and some cookie variables. This file contains
instructions on what settings need to be set and what they should be set
to. Also, this file MUST be writeable by the web server! To set this file
writeable you can issue the following command at a Unix command prompt:

chmod a+w config.php

If you do not have command line access to your web server then your FTP
client should be able to change file permissions.

3. You must check the status of MySQL. Make sure that MySQL is running on
the system and that you have a valid username/password to use with phpBB. If
your MySQL user has access to create databases on the server this is all you
have to do. If you do not have access to create databases please contact
your system administrator and have them create a database for your phpBB
install. Once you have a database to install phpBB into you are ready to
continue.

2.0.3 Running the Installer

We have tried to make the installer as user-friendly as we possible. Open your
web browser and type in the address of your phpBB install file. For example:
http://www.yoursite.com/phpBB/install.php. If you do not have the correct file
permissions on config.php you will see an error message telling you how to
correct this. If all goes well you should see the first screen of the
installer, the database information screen. You will see that values have
been set for you, these may not work for you! They are simply there to give
you an idea of what needs to be entered. Set them to the correct values before
proceeding. Next you will see a screen that tells you the status of the
database creation, if all goes well your database has now been set-up for
phpBB. After that you will be presented with the user registration screen for
the admin user. You must fill out at least the username, password, and email
fields in this form, all the rest are optional. Next you will see the forum
wide options configuration screen. This form allows you to set-up the basic
options to be used on the forum, default values have been entered for you to
give you an idea of what data you should enter.

If all goes well you should be presented with a link to the administration
panel. Congratulations, you have just installed phpBB.

If you have any problems with this install please contact us at
http://www.phpbb.com/ or support@phpbb.com and we'll try and help.

2.0.4 Post-Installation

Once you have finished the install you should make sure that you reset
config.php so that is NOT writeable by the web server. This is purely for
security reasons, you don't want just anyone writing values to that file.
You can do this by issuing the following Unix command:

chmod a-w config.php

Or, again if you don't have command line access to your server you can do
this via your FTP client.

You can now continue with section 4.0 System Setup.

3.0 Upgrading
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upgrading from older versions of phpBB is very simple. We have provided full 
upgrade scripts along with this release. There are 5 steps to upgrading:

1. Backup your old phpBB files.

2. Unpack the new phpBB distribution.

3. Edit config.php and set the values as you need. There are some changes
from the old config file so make sure you read the new file carefully.
You will also have to copy your old database configuration values over to
the new file. The values you want to copy over are 
$dbuser
$dbpasswd
$dbhost
$dbname
Make sure config.php ends with ?> and there are no blank spaces after that.

4. Open your web browser and type in the address of your phpBB upgrade
script. For Example:
http://www.yoursite.com/phpBB/upgrade_14.php
There are two different upgrade scripts. upgrade_14.php is for the conversion 
from 1.2.x to 1.4 and upgrade_12.php can be used if you are still using a
1.0.x database. In this case you'll fist have to run upgrade_12.php and after
that you can run the upgrade_14.php script to convert your DB from the 1.2 
format to the format required for 1.4.

5. Follow the instructions that the upgrade script gives you. (Basically you
just have to keep hitting next).

The upgrade script will make a backup of your old database but it is still
advisable that you also make a manual backup of the database in case
something goes very wrong.

If everything goes well, and you don't receive any errors you should now have
a working copy of phpBB v1.4.

Please don't forget to rename/move or delete the upgrade and installation
scripts because they are not needed anymore (install.php, upgrade_12.php and
upgrade_14.php).


4.0 System Setup
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order for your freshly installed forums to be useful to anyone you will
have to create (at least) one category and one forum. This section tells you
how to do this via the administration panel. Once the installer has
finished you will be provided with a link to the administration section of
the forums, once there you will have to enter the username and password of
the admin user that you created during the install. Your web browser MUST
have cookies enabled for you to use the admin panel.

4.0.1 Adding a Category

Once you enter the administration panel click on the 'Add a category' link.
You should be presented with a form where you can fill in a category name,
do so and click 'submit'. You will now see a screen that tells you that the
category has been created with a link back to the admin panel.
Congratulations, you now have your first category.

4.0.2 Adding a Forum

Once back at the administration panel click on the 'Add a Forum' link and
you will be taken to a form where you can create a new forum.

You must fill out a Forum Name, Moderator, Category, Access Level, and
type on each forum, only the Description is optional.

You must select at LEAST 1 moderator but there is no limit on the number of
moderators a forum can have.

Access level is the level of registration that a user must have before he/she
can post in the forum. Anonymous Posting means that anyone who visits the
forum can post, even those without accounts. Registered users only means
that only users that have registered with the board my post in this forum.
And finally Moderator/Administrator Only means that only moderators, super
moderators, or admins can post in that forum.

Type sets the security level on a forum. Public means anyone can view the
forum and post to. Private means that only people on the access control list
for that forum can view it, and only those how have been granted posting
rights can post to it. If you create a private forum make sure that you also
visit the 'Set Private Forum Permissions' section of the administration
panel and give viewing/posting right to the users you wish to have access to
that forum.

5.0 Conclusion
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

board that people can register and post on. You've just entered the
wonderful world of online communities. We hope you have found this document

Appendix A: Notes for Installing phpBB on windows systems.

First, thanks to our Windows using bug hunter David Tod Sigafoos for
coming up with this solution.

phpBB will only function correctly when PHP4 is installed as an ISAPI Apache
module, here are instructions for installing it as such:

1) Stop your apache server

2) Download php 4.0.3pl1 from php.net.  Download the isapi version
from here http://www.php.net/downloads.php

3) Unzip php into your directory (for me it was c:\php)

4) Copy the php4ts.dll into the windows\system directory.  (there
should only be one in system or system32)

In http.conf

5) In apache http.conf find the loadmodule section and add this line
LoadModule php4_module c:/php/sapi/php4apache.dll

6) Be sure you have the AddType for php

Also, some people have had success by adding the following line to config.php:

$PHP_SELF = $PATH_INFO;

This should only be used if you have PHP installed as a CGI module.
If you have any other problems installing on Windows please visit the
support forums at http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/
