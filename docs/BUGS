Reporting Bugs
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Found a bug? Good, we'll fix it! To report a bug you can go to the offical
phpBB forums at http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/ and post it in the 'phpBB Bug
Reports' forum (please make sure someone else hasn't already reported it
there!), or you can email it to bugs@phpbb.com

If you are emailing a bug please follow this little template:

Subject: [BUG] Brief Description
Body:
phpBB Version: <version number, You can find this in config.php or page_tail>
Web Server Software: <Apache/IIS/Whatever>
Web Server Version: <You get the idea>
PHP Version: <3.0.9/4.0.4pl1 etc etc>
Full description of error, how to reproduce it, and preferrable with a URL 
where we can check it out ourselves.

If email bugs are not submitted in this manor they will most likely get
lost in the mail! Please follow it carfully!

Thank you.
The phpBB Group.
